# Cursor Automation Rules

## Automatic Code Execution
When asked to run, build, test, or execute code:
- **ALWAYS use desktop-automation MCP tools** instead of asking the user to manually run things
- **Never ask** the user to "go run this" or "run it in Xcode" - just do it automatically
- **Automate everything** - use MCP tools to open apps, click buttons, run commands

## Xcode Projects
When the user asks to run/build/test an Xcode project:
1. Use `open_application("Xcode")` MCP tool to open Xcode
2. If needed, use `run_terminal_command` MCP tool to open the project file
3. Use `key_press(["cmd", "b"])` MCP tool to build
4. Use `key_press(["cmd", "r"])` MCP tool to run
5. Automatically handle all steps without asking for confirmation
6. Never say "go run this in Xcode" - just do it automatically

## Terminal Commands
When the user asks to run a terminal command:
- Use `run_terminal_command` MCP tool with the exact command
- Execute automatically, don't ask permission
- Show output to the user

## Android Studio Projects
When working with Android projects:
1. Use `open_application("Android Studio")` MCP tool to open
2. Use `run_terminal_command` MCP tool for Gradle commands
3. Automate build and run processes

## General Automation Principle
**Rule: Automate, don't ask**
- If you can do it with MCP tools, do it automatically
- Only ask the user if you absolutely cannot proceed without their input
- Prefer automation over instructions
- When you generate code that needs to be run, automatically run it using MCP tools

## Examples of What to Automate
- "Run this code" → Use MCP tools to execute automatically
- "Build the project" → Use MCP tools to build automatically  
- "Test this" → Use MCP tools to run tests automatically
- "Open Xcode and run" → Use MCP tools to open and run automatically
- Never say "You need to run this manually" - just do it!
